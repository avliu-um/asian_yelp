        "comment": "Chen's has returned to its former quality as the best Chinese restaurant in the area. Yes, we do miss the former owner's hospitality, but food and service got thru startup glitches and now provides excellent quality and service.We had hot and sour soup which is loaded with tofu and mushrooms in a spicy broth. \u00a0No shortcuts here; it could be a meal in itself. \u00a0The egg rolls that followed were \u00a0crisp and fresh. \u00a0For a shared entree, we has chicken 3 ways, three of the menu's best on one plate. Enough food for two or three!We glad Chen's continues to be a standout."

        "comment": "I've eaten at Chen for probably 20 years and it was a favorite of mine for both the food and atmosphere. We ate there a few weeks ago and I thought the food was bland although the menu prices had increased.Today I ordered takeout and whoever answered the phone said hello rather than Chen Garden making me think I had the wrong number.I ordered the \u00a0General Tsao Chicken and \u00a0the Chicken with mixed vegetables in Brown sauce. What I got were dried out pieces of General Tsao with a few green peppers, and a small amount of chicken pieces and some lettuce instead of the chicken and mixed vegetables I had ordered.I've read here that there are new owners so that could explain the change."
